# Git Assignment - Xiaoxiao-Gong
a. What is an issue?
With my understanding, Issues on GitHub is like a to do list, it can be used for record tasks/advices, or maybe debug suggestions, and then everyone (has access to the repo) can create a issue to tracking these issues and questions, discuss and label them.

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request is a process that use for merging changes from one branch to the another one, just like our shell-assignemnt, after we finish the assignment, we pull request from assignment branch to the main (our repo from DSI), and the differences can be seen. I think it could be used for code review and collaboration in a organization/group. 

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
Navigate to my repository on GitHub
Switch to the branch I want to merge from
Click on the "Pull requests" tab, the second button
Click the "New pull request" button
Review and make sure everything is correct
Add a title and description
Click "Create pull request", then it's submitted
This will notify the repository maintainers(ex. DSI) that my changes are ready for review and merging

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
Navigate to my repository
Click "Settings"
On the left sidebar, click "Collaborators & teams
In the "Manage access" section, click "Invite a collaborator
Enter the GitHub username or email address of the person I want to invite.
Click "Add username to this repository
The invited user will receive an invitation to accept
Once that user accept the invitation, the user will have write access to the repository

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a distributed version control system, I could track changes, and collaborate with others, in other words, git is like record the every scene of the task.
but Github is a web-based platform, it could store git repository like our DSi program and the corresponding module, this platform has mange tools, for example, pull request and issues.

f. What does git diff do?
It shows the differences between the working directory and the index staging area, between the index and the last commit, or between two commits. It highlights the changes that have been made, allowing developers to see what has been added or removed. For example, on github, the red background part shows which parts have been deleted, the green background part shows which contents has been added.

g. What is the main branch?
It is the default branch in a repository. All other branches are usually merged into the main branch once they are complete and reviewed.
For example, we merge the assignment branch to the main of our repository.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
No, it is a common practice to create a new branch for the changes. This will allow review and test process before merging.
